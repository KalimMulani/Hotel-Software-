# Java Desktop Swing Application for Hotel Management with MySQL JDBC Connectivity

## Project Description

This GitHub project demonstrates a hotel management software application built using Java Swing for the graphical user interface (GUI) and MySQL JDBC for database connectivity. The application provides a user-friendly interface for managing hotel operations, including guest check-ins and check-outs, room bookings, and billing, with robust backend integration for seamless database operations. The combination of Swing and MySQL JDBC ensures an efficient experience for both users and developers.

## Key Features

1. **User-Friendly GUI with Swing**:
    - **Responsive Design**: Create a dynamic and interactive user interface using Java Swing components such as JFrame, JPanel, JButton, JLabel, JTextField, JTable, and more.
    - **Room and Booking Management**: Implement forms for data entry, updates, and deletions related to room details, bookings, guest information, and billing records.
    - **Real-time Feedback**: Provide real-time feedback to users through message dialogs and status indicators.

2. **Database Connectivity with MySQL JDBC**:
    - **Database Operations**: Establish a connection to a MySQL database and perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations using JDBC.
    - **Prepared Statements**: Utilize prepared statements to prevent SQL injection and ensure secure database transactions.
    - **Error Handling**: Implement robust error handling mechanisms to manage database connectivity issues and SQL errors.

3. **Data Management**:
    - **Guest Information**: Manage guest details such as names, addresses, contact information, and booking records.
    - **Room Availability**: Track room availability and status to facilitate booking management.
    - **Billing and Payments**: Generate and manage billing information, track payments, and update records accordingly.
